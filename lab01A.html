            This is the journal page for my first lab assignment. In this lab I decided to write a website which can be used to view all the journals that I write
            for this semester. At the moment it is pretty basic but what I focused on today was creating the style I'd like the page to have. This was done using
            both inline CSS and an external styles.css file which is linked to each page. I plan on making changes throughout the semester and if it is acceptable
            I would like to use it as a hub for all my journals that we do in our labs. I will create a page for each journal so that they can be easily accessible
            and a little more fun to view than a basic word or text file. I enjoyed our first Zoom meeting and I really look forward to learning some Java.

			The website I used while studying for this hour of code journal is <a href="www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a>. Particularly the <a href="www.w3schools.com/html">HTML</a> and <a href="www.w3schools.com/css">CSS</a>
			tutorials on this site. I've spent a lot of time using Python and C++ in the past and occasionally I've delved into some HTML, CSS and Javascript. So
			I chose to learn some more HTML and CSS they are very useful languages to know these days, and they're fun to use.

            Today I learned how to create a navbar that stays at the top of the page, even when you scroll down through the content on each page. The navbar above was made 
			using some buttons each with some Javascript which is placed in the <b>onclick</b> that loads the page for the button you click.
			I will use a <b>&lt;pre&gt;</b> html element below which will preserve the format of the periods that appear after this paragraph, in order to demonstrate the persistent navbar as well as the
            function of the <b>&lt;pre&gt;</b> element itself.
