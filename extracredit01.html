        <h4>One hour of learning Java</h4>
        <p>
            <b>8:00pm</b> - I have just opened up the Java tutorials page at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/java</a>. Some background information about Java
            includes that it was created in 1995, is owned by Oracle, and used for many purposes. It works on nearly all platforms and it's a very popular programming language. Because I already have a foothold in C++
            I should be able to grasp Java pretty quickly.

            One difference between C++ and Java that I never knew is that Java requires every line of code to be within a class. This concept is new to me, so I'm learning already! Similar to C++ though Java requires that
            there be a main() method which is where most of your code will exist.
