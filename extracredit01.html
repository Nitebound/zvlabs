        <h4>One hour of learning Java</h4>
        <p>
            <b>8:00pm - </b> I have just opened up the Java tutorials page at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/java</a>. Some background information about Java
            includes that it was created in 1995, is owned by Oracle, and used for many purposes. It works on nearly all platforms and it's a very popular programming language. Because I already have a foothold in C++
            I should be able to grasp Java pretty quickly.

            One difference between C++ and Java that I never knew is that Java requires every line of code to be within a class. This concept is new to me, so I'm learning already! Similar to C++ though Java requires that
            there be a main() method which is where most of your code will exist. Another comfortable similarity to C++ is how comments are defined with <b>//</b> for single line comments and <b>/* ... */</b> for multi-line comments.
            With <b>...</b> being the actual comment text. Creating a variable is also nearly identical to how you would in C++, which would be by typing the variable type, name of the variable and what it is equal to in the format 
            "<i>type myVariable = value</i>". You can redefine the variable using the following format "<i>myInt = 100</i>".

            <b>8:30pm - </b>
            When coming up with names for your variables you want them to give some idea of what the variable is used for. Trying to keep the variable name short isn't always ideal as it can make your code less understandable even to you
            when you come back to review it sometime later. The standard naming convention for variables in Java is called camelCase. Using camelCase implies that you start the name of the variable with lowercase letters and if the variables
            name contains more than one word then you capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word in the name like this "<b>myVariableName</b>". Some of the built in data types for Java include <b>int, float, char, byte, boolean and String</b>.
            There are a number of other ones but these are the primary few that you will use the most. These define what kind of data that variable will contain. A String holds a string of characters, defined within double-quotation marks. An int
            stores an integer or whole number. In Java you can use the method  <b>System.out.println(value)</b> where <i>value</i> is the actual text or number which you want to output to the console. aka the command line. You can pass a variety of 
            types as an argument to the println method including all of the types listed earlier in this paragraph. When you pass a variable into the println method, your program will print whatever value is held within that variable.
        </p>

            <b>8:45pm - </b>
            The last thing that I observed during this hour of learning Java is how to cast variables from one type to another. Java can automatically cast types like an int to a float by writing "int myInt = 0;"  and then setting a new float variable to that integer
            value like this "float myFloat = myInt;". This will cause the myFloat variable to turn the value held in myInt into a floating point number. Additionally you can manually cast an int to a float by typing, for example "float myFloat = 2.953;" and next
            set an int variable to the value of the float with this little trick "int myInt = (int) myFloat;". Doing this will cut off the numbers after the decimal point resulting in our myInt variable being equal to 2. It is important to be aware that casting a float
            to an int does not round the floating point number and instead simply removes any numbers after the decimal point. That is why 2.953 turns to 2 after being cast to an int, as opposed to being rounded to 3.
        </p>

            In summary I've become a little more familiar with the syntax of Java, and some of the differences between it and C++. I compare to C++ because I'm already quite familiar with C++ so it's helped me to better understand how Java works. Next time I'll get a little
            more into some real coding and post some screenshots of what I've done. Thanks for reading :).
