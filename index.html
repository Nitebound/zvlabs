        <h2>My Background in Programming</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Zachery Visger and I've had great interest in computers and programming since I was young. I got my first laptop when I was 11 and the idea came to mind that
        maybe I can make my own video games! I first started out by using a game engine called GameMaker. It really took me a while to grasp how to get anything done with it and
        it had it's own programming language called GML(GameMaker Language). You could use the simple drag and drop interface to build your game but if you wanted to do anything
        sort of advanced, you had to learn GML. So that happened to be the first programming language that I ever learned.
        
        <p>      
        Many years have gone by since then and I've learned quite 
        a few programming languages over that time including C, C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, BASIC and touched on some others. I've only ever done it as a hobby, and
        I taught myself everything I know so far about programming but I decided I really wanted to work towards a career in it due to my lasting passion for the art. So that's
        what's lead me here to MJC and I'm excited to continue learning.
        </p>

        I'm not exactly an expert but I'll do what I can to help out.
